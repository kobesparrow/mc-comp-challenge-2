#### Biggest Win
Sitting down over the course of 36 hours and building out the entire site as it appears here. Troubleshooting was efficient and successful, the page layout responded as I hoped, and I added the new skill of being able to build an SVG.

#### Biggest Struggle
Coming back to the project after 10 days expecting to make final styling and positioning changes and having no idea where to being and being overwhelemed by the code I left myself.

This taught me two things: (1)The workflow of "get it on the page and worry about it later" is not good practice. Better to move methodically get each piece correct and perfect before moving on to the next piece of the puzzle. Agile page building as opposed to waterfall. (2)My code needs to be more semantic and more dry in order to successfully pass it on to other coders. If I can't interpret my own code, how can I expect others to understand it?

#### Assignment
Assigned comprehensive layout (note: creative liberty allowed for content)
